# About me:

I am a young student of computer science, ex-
student of physics, which is why I have a good
command of mathematics, research, project
formulation, and scientific computing. I am
also a full stack developer in training. The main
goal in my future job will be to learn as much
as I can, gaining knowledge from practice. I
am good at teamwork, following instructions,
and completing tasks, although I have also
held the position of leader in different
university projects, a role in which I feel
comfortable.
